I created this code for Prof. Bill Howe's Data Science Coursera course.

[Here is my Coursera profile.](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/62da43c330791faf1444ba89f764e988)


These pieces of code perform various tasks on a data set of Twitter feed, "output.txt". Each code script describes the task that it performs.

The scripts included are:

`frequency.py`

Outputs the frequency of each term in the tweets.

`happiest_state.py`

Outputs the happiest USA state in the tweets.

`term_sentiment.py`

Outputs the sentiment score for all terms in the tweets, including new terms.

`top_ten.py`

Outputs the top ten hashtags.

`tweet_sentiment.py`

Outputs the sentiment score for each of the tweets in the dataset.


AFINN-111.txt is a dictionary of words and sentiment scores.

You are more than welcome to generate your own Twitter dataset. I generated my dataset with the code and instructions in twitterstream.py.
